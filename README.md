# BBEDIT-ASTERISK
Language module for Asterisk (Digium)

1. To use drop the .plist file into: /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/
2. Drop the Asterisk.bbColorScheme file into /Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Color Schemes/
3. Select the Color Scheme (or use your own!) and select the Language Module at the bottom of the text editor if it does not do so automatically.

See http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/plugin_library.html for more installation instructions
This may work with Textwrangler as well but I have not tested it.
